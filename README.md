# Validator

**WIP**

This is a simple input validator for go programs which can be used to test inputs at the boundary of your application.

It uses a fluent API to allow chaining of validators to keep things concise and terse.

There is also a provided Validator interface which can applied to structs and tested in the like of http handlers or middleware.
